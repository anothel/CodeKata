### 문제 설명

<p>Every year, the Mines freshman class assembles on the football field to take a class photo. Usually, the students arrange themselves to create a giant M. Unfortunately, the students took too long to set up, causing Blaster to get hungry and eat the ropes outlining the M. Thinking quickly, the teachers assemble the students in a rectangle. Given that this rectangle is $w$ people by $l$ people, how many students are in the freshman class?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer $w$ ($1 \leq w \leq 10^4$), the width of the rectangle.</p>

<p>The second line of input contains a single integer $l$ ($1 \leq l \leq 10^4$), the length of the rectangle. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>The only line of output should be a single integer, the total number of students in the freshman class.</p>
